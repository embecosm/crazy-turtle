This project is an attempt implement turtle graphics for the CrazyFlie 2.0
qaudcopter.  The goal is to enable users to control a Crazyflie's motion using
simple commands from a computer.

## Initial code base

The initial code is just experimental tests of the Crazyflie API.  Before we
can implement turtle graphics, we need need stable control of the quadcopter
from a compyuter.
