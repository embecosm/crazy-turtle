	Attempt to implement the "alt hold" functionality.  Holding level
	works, going up/down does not.

	* experiments/alt_hold/alt_hold.py:

	* experiments/pid_jump/dataview.ods: Deleted.
	* experiments/pid_jump/pid-data.ods: Updated with latest flight data.
	* experiments/pid_jump/pid_jump.py
	(MotorPidJumpExample._connected): Clarify meaning of ASL and
	normalize, using raw values.
	(MotorJumpExample._jump_motors): Use explicit initial value of
	ASL, based on understanding of its meaning.

	* experiments/pid_jump/pid_jump.py
	(MotorPidJumpExample._log_data): Don't invert yaw.
	(MotorJumpExample._jump_motors): Set init values that seem to work
	for roll, pitch and yaw.  Set Kp for roll, pitch and yaw by
	experiment.  Rename thrust_ctrl to aslCtrl.  Wider thrust limits.
	Output of control is change to roll, pitch and yaw, not absolute
	value.
